# My web-dev starter kit

Node server w/express serving /public.

This kit uses webpack to process js (from /js) and SASS (from /scss) to generate .js and .css into /public. Babel is used in compiling to allow for compatibility of ES6 functionality. The server is a simple HTTP server using Express to server items statically.

I use this as a boiler plate for basic sites to React apps. Additional packages etc are needed, but this is usually all I need to get started.

This has an open license. Feel free to hack away at it and use what you'd like - that's what I did.
